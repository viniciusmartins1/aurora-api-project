# What is Aurora project?
It's an open source project, written in .NET Core, currently in version 3.1.

The project's goals is to show that is possible to create an architecture more simple than others and using some concepts like DDD (Design Driven Design).

## Business proposal:
This project is a simple PPE (Personal Protective Equipament) Management. The principle idea is to register workers and PPE and, with this data, allow to transfer PPE to a worker.
Besides that, this system allow that you see all PPE and who has a PPE and notify if the PPE is near to expire.

### Abbreviations:
* NIN: National Insurance Number (as CPF in Brazil)

## How to use:
1. Clone this project to into your machine
2. Use the default connection string or:
    2.1. Install and configure [MySql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/), if you want.
    2.2. Inform the connection string on Aroura.Infra.Data/Context/MySqlContext.cs, if necessary
    * Put the server name on [SERVER] tag
    * Put the port number on [PORT] tag
    * Put the user name database on [USER] tag
    * Put the password database on [PASSWORD] tag
4. Finally, build and run the application

## MySql Migrations:
1. Open your Package Manager Console
2. Change the default project to Aurora.Infra.Data
3. Run command "Add-Migration [NAME OF YOUR MIGRATION]"
4. Run command "Update-Database"

## Why Aurora?
The name Aurora came from the natural event called Aurora Borealis. It is a scientific event described by the interaction between the earth's magnetic layer and energized particles from the solar wind.

A curiosity about such an event is that what we see in photographs is not always the same image that is seen live.
